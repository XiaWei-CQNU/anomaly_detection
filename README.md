=================================================
-----

## Read Me First
This is a code base for storing time series anomaly detection models. It includes dataset processing, model training and testing, evaluation index functions, and analysis of experimental storage.

## Dataset Preprocessing
Preprocess all datasets using the command run dataset/preprocess.py file:
```python
python3 preprocess.py <dataset_name>
```
where <dataset_name> can be MSL SMD MSDS MBA.Distribution rights to some datasets may not be available. Check the readme files in the ./data/ folder for more details.
